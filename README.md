## Overview Requirement

This assignment is designed to have you practice working with HTML and the DOM in order to create both static and dynamic web content.

You are asked to prototype a fictional Music App.  Your app will focus on a specific music genre and allow users to browse different artists and find specific songs.  Because your appâ€™s artists and songs will change frequently, we often separate our data from its UI representation.  This allows us to quickly make changes and have the app always use the most current music catalogue
